        <p> 1st: Liverpool  </p>
        
        <p> Liverpool has one of the strongest teams in the premier league right now. With a few good signings this transfer window to reinforce their bench, they could win the premier league.  </p>
        
        <p> 2nd: Manchester City </p>
        
        <img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/256a736372df1e6b13dec87c8e699117d9a285a4/0_97_4413_2650/master/4413.jpg?width=445&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c56dbc49e84a4db88f43d5ee6be0f2f7">
        
        <p> Manchester City can be the strongest team in the premier league. Their problem is their inconsistency. During last season, they dropped points  to teams that they shouldn't have. Newcastle and Wolves to name a few. If they can drop the inconsistency, then I think they have the ability to become premier league champions.    </p>
        
        <p> 3rd: Chelsea </p>
        
        <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_736,h_485,c_fill,g_auto,f_auto/https%3A%2F%2Ftheprideoflondon.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fgetty-images%2F2017%2F07%2F1185082508-850x560.jpeg">
        
        <p> With the arrival of signings Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech Chelsea look like they will have another strong season. They are still have a decent gap on the rest of the teams in the premier league, but Liverpool and Manchester City still have a fairly sizeable gap on Chelsea. They still need to make a few more good signings to be able to take a shot at the premier league title. </p>
        
        <p> 4th: Manchester United </p>
        
        <img src="https://d3nfwcxd527z59.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2020/08/25111934/Sadio-Mane-Liverpool-v-Manchester-United-2019-554x301.jpg">
        
        <p>  With the arrival of Bruno Fernandes, Manchester United leaped into the top 4. However, they still need to make some other signings other than Odion Ighalo. There are still some signings that they need to make to solve from pressing needs to allow them to stay in the top 4. Particularily, they need to find a partner for Bruno Fernandes because as time goes on, opponents will find a way to shut Bruno down.</p>
        
        <p> 5th: Leicester City </p>
        
        <img src="https://i2-prod.leicestermercury.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article4296160.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Jamie-Vardy.jpg">
        
        <p> Leicester City struggled at the end of the season, losing their champions league spot. If they don't want a repeat of last season, they need to make some changes. Firstly, they will want to find a more reliable second striker for Jamie Vardy. If they can find a more reliable second striker for Jamie Vardy then I think they could achieve champions league qualification. </p>
        
        <p> 6th: Wolves </p>
        
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article16967475.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1176358429.jpg">
        
        <p> Wolves have had an amazing time in the premier league these past two years. They got Europa League qualification in their first season, and just missed out on the Europa League this year. If they can have a bit more consistency. Then I think they could qualify for the Europa League next season.   </p>
        
        <p> 7th: Tottenham Hotspurs </p>
        
        <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_736,h_485,c_fill,g_auto,f_auto/https%3A%2F%2Feverythingbarca.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fgetty-images%2F2018%2F08%2F1178391240-850x560.jpeg">
        
        <p> Tottenham are not in the champions league season, and they lacked consistency throughout the whole season. One week they were destroying teams beating big 6 teams 2-1 away, the next, they were losing to teams that were in relagation battles. Without that consistency, it will be nearly impossible to challenge for the top 4. </p>
        
        <p> 8th: Sheffield United  </p>
        
        <img src="https://resources.premierleague.com/photos/2019/09/27/f4e461d2-0703-4743-ace6-dfe02d9474e3/Sheffield-Utd-Digital-Membership.jpg?width=500&height=333">
        
        <p> Sheffield United were the reincarnation of Wolves this season. While they didn't have aren't playing any european matches, finishing 9th in your first premier league season in 13 years. Chris Wilders team still needs a replacement for Dean Henderson who went back to United after his loan spell ended. If they could find a long term replacement. They would have another  wonderful time in the premier league this season. </p>
        
        <p> 9th: Arsenal  </p>
        
        <img src="https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article18095943.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1211001709.jpg">
        
        <p> Arsenal are the premier league version of AC Milan. They were once  a glorious team during the 2000's but they are now a midtable team. Without the FA Cup, Arsenal could now regularily miss European football, and their wreckless spending isn't helping. Reinforcing that horrible defence, and consistently using the same system, and the might be able to come back from this clubs "dark ages".   </p>
        
        <p> 10th: Leeds United  </p>
        
        <img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kPapnPGWPj.Sh06MFwbI3Q--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/rotoworld.com/5ef1d5cbdc286c4d34c6d0e678be55ad">
        
        <p> I think that Leed will be this version of Wolves. With their strong team I think they will easily survive this premier league season, but because of how strong the competition is for Europe this season and the fact that they haven't tasted top flight life in over 17 years.  </p>
      </div>

      <div class="box-4">
        
        <p> 11th: Everton  </p>
        
        <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hsbH0MNG-WNC_3B8yRD2qUlwE28=/0x0:5568x3712/1200x675/filters:focal(2746x975:3636x1865)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67231359/1254870730.jpg.0.jpg">
        
        <p> Everton, the worse Merseyside team. I don't think that they can make it into the top 10 because of how strong the competition are. I think that they can easily survive relagation but they won't make it into the top 10.  </p>
        
        <p> 12th: Burnley  </p>
        
        <img src="https://e2.365dm.com/20/06/2048x1152/skysports-mee-burnley-football_5019582.jpg">
        
         <p> Burnley is the modern version of Stoke City. Like stoke, I don't think that they will make it into the top 10, but like Everton, they will survive relagation with their castle. They made Everton, Leicester, Tottenham, Sheffield United, and Wolves drop points at Turf Moor. So I think that they will survive relegation easily.   </p>
         
         <p> 13th: Southampton  </p>
         
         <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_736,h_485,c_fill,g_auto,f_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsaintsmarching.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fgetty-images%2F2020%2F08%2F1257041859-850x560.jpeg">
         
         <p> Apart from that 0-9 home spanking to Leicester, Southampton had a pretty good season. They might have a tougher season because of the 13 month long season, but other than that, I don't have much to say. I think they'll be just fine. </p>
         
         <p> 14th: Newcastle  </p>
         
         <img src="https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2019/12/08132620/GettyImages-1192685648-e1575829610360-1024x683.jpg">
         
         <p> Newcastle are gonna struggle this season. With the Saudia Arabia prince takoever deal at a stand still, I think that they will really struggle this season. With the worst flop in the clubs history called Joelinton and Miguel Almiron who has kinda come into form, I think that they will struggle without much attacking power other than Allan Saint-Maximin. Defensively, the signing of jeff Hendrick will help, but a team will always struggle without much attacking power. </p>
         
         <p> 15th: Brighton  </p>
         
         <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lJinGaUl0SzRulb_ztkDiedVG3A=/0x0:4678x3119/1200x800/filters:focal(1608x1237:2356x1985)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67272118/1227793514.jpg.0.jpg">
         
         <p> Brighton have no intention of moving up the table. While it might be nice, Brighton is just happy staying up. With the team that they have, I think that they can stay up. While it may not be easy, I think that brighton will enjoy the struggle and journey of fighting to stay up in the premier league, and I respect that.   </p>
         
         <p> 16th: West Bromwich Albion   </p>
         
         <img src="https://worldsportstale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ccelebritiesfoto0_GettyImages-1129590456-900x480.jpg">
         
         <p> West Brom were dead last in the 2017/18 season. With their team now, I think that they can survive the battle for relagation. Thei team is a whole lot stronger and I think that they can survive the drop this year.  </p>
         
         <p> 17th: Fulham  </p>
         
         <img src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newcitizens/pages/3091/meta_images/original/fulham.PNG?1531827664">
         
         <p> Fulham are a different team from the team that got KO'ed out of the premier league 2 seasons ago. Their team is stronger and more defensively solid. I think that they can survive relegation this season, while they might survive by the skin of their teeth. I think that they can do it.   </p>
         
         <p> 18th: Crystal Palace  </p>
         
         <img src="https://resources.premierleague.com/photos/2019/09/27/6f2b4f30-5824-4b61-be9e-eedcaa3238b3/Crystal-Palace-Digital-Membership.jpg?width=500&height=333">
         
         <p> This drop has kind of been a long time coming. With all the problems Crystal Palace have had I think that with all the problems they have had with their team, I think that it's a good thing. Just reset in the championship and comeback stronger.  </p>
         
         <p> 19th: Aston Villa  </p>
         
         <img src="https://resources.premierleague.com/photos/2019/09/27/fc5bda26-e3b3-4751-b55a-de9d7e8f94d9/Aston-Villa-Digital-Membership.jpg?width=500&height=333">
         
         
        <p> Aston Villa barely survived the drop. I don't think that they can survive the drop this year. Other teams in the premier league have improved their defences and their attacks, and with the upgrades coming from some of their relegation rivals, I simply don't think that they can survive the drop. I think that Villa will also look at what happpened, what went wrong and what went right. Then they will reset like Crystal Palace. </p>
        
        <p> 20th: West Ham United  </p>
        
        <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_736,h_485,c_fill,g_auto,f_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fgreenstreethammers.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fgetty-images%2F2017%2F07%2F1268476436-850x560.jpeg">
        
        <p> Relegation would be a blessing in disguise for West Ham. Their owners are delusional and believe they should be challenging for Europe. But they can't, they don't have the means to.  With the players they have lost over the past few seasons they can't survive. If they keep on surviving they won't make any progress. Each season that they survive relegation is another season wasted. They need to get relegated for their own good. Then they can come back into the premier league the following season with owners that actually have realistic expecations. They can then build on that then maybe in the future they can challenge for the top 10 and Europe.   </p>
